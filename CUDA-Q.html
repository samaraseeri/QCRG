    <h1>Nvidia is excited to announce the release of the first set of notebooks for CUDA-Q Academic</h1>
    <p>This initiative aims to provide practical, hands-on experience with quantum algorithms and hybrid quantum-classical computing, leveraging the powerful CUDA-Q platform.</p>

    <h2>Description of the Notebooks</h2>
    <p>The initial set of modules includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Textbook Example of QAOA for Max-Cut:** Students start with a fundamental example to understand the basics of the QAOA algorithm.</li>
        <li>**Circuit Cutting:** Techniques for breaking down large quantum circuits into smaller, more manageable pieces.</li>
        <li>**Parallel QPU/GPU Workflows:** Execution of quantum algorithms on quantum processing units (QPUs) and graphical processing units (GPUs) in parallel.</li>
        <li>**Adaptations of QAOA:** Exploring modifications to the QAOA algorithm to enhance performance and scalability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>These modules are suitable for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Students with a basic understanding of quantum algorithms and experience with Python.</li>
        <li>Majors such as data science, computer science, and physics.</li>
        <li>Individuals familiar with variational algorithms, though this is not a strict requirement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The notebooks can serve as a week-long module or a project at the end of an introductory quantum computing course.</p>

    <h2>Future Materials and Collaboration</h2>
    <p>NVIDIA is actively developing additional materials to expand the repository. We welcome collaboration from the community to create new notebooks and enhance the existing ones.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To access the notebooks:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit the [NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic GitHub repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic).</li>
        <li>Download the notebooks and run them locally or on Google Colab.</li>
    </ol>
