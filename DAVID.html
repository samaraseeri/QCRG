    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Prof. David Keyes is recognized as one of the <strong>35 legends in high-performance computing</strong> and serves as a <strong>Professor of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering</strong> at <strong>KAUST (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology)</strong>. He will be the keynote speaker at the <strong>Symposium of Quantum Computing & Technology</strong> at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals - KFUPM and at the <strong>LEAP in Riyadh</strong>, discussing <strong>"Shaping Economics of Future Technologies and People."</strong></p>

    <p>As a founding <strong>Dean and Director of the Extreme Computing Research Center</strong> since 2009, Dr. Keyes has focused on scalable solvers for power-aware architectures. His collaborations in energy and environmental applications have led to groundbreaking methods, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Pseudo-Transient Continuation (ÏˆTC)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Inexact Newton (ASPIN)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Hierarchical Computations on Manycore Architectures (HiCMA)</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Before joining KAUST, he led projects at the <strong>U.S. Department of Energy (DoE)</strong> and contributed to <strong>NASA collaborations</strong> while teaching at <strong>Columbia, Old Dominion, and Yale</strong>. A Fellow of SIAM, AMS, and AAAS, he has received numerous awards, including two <strong>Gordon Bell Prize</strong>, the last in climate in 2024, and HPCWire recognition as <strong>one of the 35 "legends" in high-performance computing</strong>.</p>
