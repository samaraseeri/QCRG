    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>David Keyes is a Professor of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). He delivered keynote addresses at the Symposium of Quantum Computing & Technology at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM) and the Research, Development, and Innovation Authority (RDIA) LEAP satellite in Riyadh, focusing on "Shaping Economics of Future Technologies and People."</p>

    <p>As a founding Dean in 2009 and founding Director of the Extreme Computing Research Center in 2012, Keyes has focused on power-austere scalable solvers for emerging architectures. His collaborations in energy and environmental applications have helped launch popular algorithms, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS)</li>
        <li>Pseudo-Transient Continuation (ÏˆTC)</li>
        <li>Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Inexact Newton (ASPIN)</li>
        <li>Hierarchical Computations on Manycore Architectures (HiCMA)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Before joining KAUST, he led projects at the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) and contributed to NASA collaborations while teaching at Columbia, Old Dominion, and Yale. A Fellow of SIAM, AMS, and AAAS, he has received numerous awards, including two Gordon Bell Prizes, the most in climate in 2024, and HPCWire recognition as one of the 35 "legends" in high-performance computing.</p>
