      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>A revolution is coming in computing – not a paradigm shift, but a new paradigm that will complement the classical computing infrastructure of today's science, society, technology, and economy. Quantum computing is not yet a practical, reliable, or cost-effective technology rivaling classical computing for many (if any) purposes, but it is already a tantalizing object of study – quantum hardware, quantum software, quantum algorithms, and their beneficial implications for the sustainable future of humanity.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, no organization, company, or nation can afford to be without "quantum sovereignty." Q-day is coming when gate-based quantum processors boasting approximately 5000 logical qbits will apply Shor's algorithm to break RSA 2048 encryption, exposing communications that have not been migrated to post-quantum cryptography. Well before Q-day arrives, such quantum technologies (decryption and post-quantum encryption) will be embargoed. Those left on the outside will rue the years lost in getting ready and training the quantum workforce. Therefore, we at KAUST are getting started by gathering regularly to report on our readings of developments in quantum computing and to hear from vendors and early users.</p>

      <p>This website carries our announcements and points to our online resources.</p>
