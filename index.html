      <h2>Short-Term Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify research areas at KAUST that can benefit from quantum computation</li>
        <li>Prepare for a significant thrust in the Economies of the Future RDIA pillar</li>
        <li>Propose a list of speakers for workshops on quantum computation</li>
        <li>Get ready to utilize quantum hardware from NEOM and Aramco</li>
        <li>Evaluate the evolving implications of quantum computing</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
