<h1 id="welcome">Welcome to the Quantum Computing Reading Group at KAUST</h1>
<p>A revolution is coming in computing – not a paradigm shift, but a new paradigm that will complement the classical computing infrastructure of today's science, society, technology, and economy. Quantum computing is not yet a practical, reliable, or cost-effective technology rivaling classical computing for many (if any) purposes, but it is already a tantalizing object of study – quantum hardware, quantum software, quantum algorithms,... and their beneficial implications for the sustainable future of humanity.</p>

<p>Furthermore, no organization, company, or nation can afford to be without "quantum sovereignty." Q-day is coming when gate-based quantum processors boasting approximately 5000 logical qbits will apply Shor's algorithm to break RSA 2048 encryption, exposing communications that have not been migrated to post-quantum cryptography. Well before Q-day arrives, such quantum technologies (decryption and post-quantum encryption) will be embargoed. Those left on the outside will rue the years lost in getting ready and training the quantum workforce. Therefore, we at KAUST are getting started by gathering regularly to report on our readings of developments in quantum computing and to hear from vendors and early users.</p>

<p>This website carries our announcements and points to our online resources.</p>

<h2 id="short-term-goals">Our Short-Term Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identify thrusts in the KAUST research mission that may benefit currently or in the future from quantum computation</li>
<li>Place KAUST on the "on-ramp" for a significant thrust of the Economies of the Future RDIA pillar, which is likely to become a Saudi national initiative in 2025</li>
<li>Propose a "wish list" of speakers for visits to KAUST, potentially as a part of a workshop on quantum computation to be offered Kingdom-wide in 2025</li>
<li>Prepare the KAUST community to make early use of quantum hardware acquired by NEOM (ORCA) and Aramco (Pasqal), as well as quantum computing systems available remotely for free or low-cost exploration in research clouds abroad</li>
<li>Burst the hype bubble of quantum computing and come to a realistic appraisal of its evolving implications for advancing science and engineering</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="long-term-prospects">Long-Term Prospects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spawn additional specialty groups, as appropriate, to go deeper into aspects of quantum computation relevant to particular areas but requiring more background in physics, mathematics, or computer science than the group has as a whole possesses...</li>
