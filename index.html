      <h2>Short-Term Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify thrusts in the KAUST research mission that may benefit currently or in the future from quantum computation</li>
        <li>Place KAUST on the “on-ramp” for a significant thrust of the Economies of the Future RDIA pillar</li>
        <li>Propose a “wish list” of speakers for visits to KAUST</li>
        <li>Prepare the KAUST community to make early use of quantum hardware acquired by NEOM and Aramco</li>
        <li>Burst the hype bubble of quantum computing and come to a realistic appraisal of its evolving implications</li>
      </ul>
